 - since glfw 3.3.8 (or pyglfw update?), glfw.wait_events() blocks completely
 - glfw.post_empty_event() doesn't seem to do anything (might be pyglfw issue)
 - glfw.wait_events() doesn't wait, but returns immediately
 - window minimizes if fullscreen window loses focus or un-fullscreens
    - (this seems to only happen when glfw.swap_buffers() was called)
 - glfw.swap_buffers() blocks completely when window is minimized
 - primary monitor is incorrect
 - should be a way to maximize to the _current_ monitor
 - creating a 1920x1080 window becomes maximized; it shouldn't
 - pyglfw 2.2.0 uses about 10% CPU for animated rendering, 2.5.4 25%?
