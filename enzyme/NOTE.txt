commit 9572bea606a6145dad153cd712653d6cf10ef18e

The project seems abandoned (no commits since 2015, ignored pull requests), but
fabella needs something to read MKV attachments. So this is a local copy,
patched to support attachments.

It's now been updated to (patched) commit 4b0e3c4, 2025-09-05.
Apparently it's being developed again? Maybe upstream patch.
