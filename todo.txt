 - create quad group for tiles
 - don't destroy tiles on video play, just hide; fix "playing" update for tiles

 - Use upstream enzyme? (this version is patched for attachment support)
 - Fix sometimes-crash on seek (probably because MPV thread stuff)
 - Fix GLFW bugs
 - Split out file I/O etc to its own thread
 - Make symlinks for tagged
 - Add configuration file
 - Add background
 - Menu animations
 - OpenGL error checking
 - Improve drawing effiency (remove OpenGL immediate mode)

 - Videos with non-square pixels are poorly supported; video playback is letterboxed; thumbnails get squashed (IT crowd)

 - Copy better thumbnail generation from mkv-gencover
 - Have clerk preserve state across renames
