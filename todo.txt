 - Use upstream python-mpv (0.5.2 is broken for x11_display, see issue 169; 1.0.1 requires newer mpv)
 - Use upstream enzyme? (this version is patched for attachment support)
 - Fix sometimes-crash on seek (probably because MPV thread stuff)
 - Fix GLFW bugs
 - Split out file I/O etc to its own thread
 - Make symlinks for tagged
 - Add configuration file
 - Add background
 - Menu animations
 - Abstract out glfw key events
 - Videos with non-square pixels are poorly supported; video playback is letterboxed; thumbnails get squashed (IT crowd)
 - Perhaps display multiple seasons in one menu? Separated by a text header?
 - Copy better thumbnail generation from mkv-gencover
 - Have a look at performance, in particular drawing tiles (defer image/font rendering to render threads?)
 - Text objects that are hidden shouldn't render when their text is updated
 - Dark mode should also postpone video position updates
 - Add menu sleep timer
 - Better subtitle UI
 - X11 support
 - See if EGL force in fabella.py is still needed
