 - Use upstream python-mpv (why did I even use a local copy? I'm sure I had a reason...)
 - Fix sometimes-crash on seek (probably because MPV thread stuff)
 - Fix GLFW bugs
 - Split out file I/O etc to its own thread
 - Make symlinks for tagged
 - Add configuration file
 - Add background
 - Menu animations
 - OpenGL error checking
 - Improve drawing effiency (remove OpenGL immediate mode)
 - Abstract out glfw key events
 - Videos with non-square pixels are poorly supported; video playback is letterboxed; thumbnails get squashed (IT crowd)
 - Perhaps display multiple seasons in one menu? Separated by a text header?
 - Copy better thumbnail generation from mkv-gencover
 - Have clerk preserve state across renames
