 - Fix position sometimes resetting to 0 when stopping video
 - Fix sometimes-crash on seek (probably because MPV thread stuff)
 - Fix GLFW bugs
 - Display time/title/etc on movie with osd stuff
 - Split out file I/O etc to its own thread
 - Maybe just use position for new/watching/watched state?
 - Add configuration file
 - Add background
 - Menu animations
 - OpenGL error checking
 - Improve drawing effiency (remove OpenGL immediate mode)
 - Abstract out glfw key events
 - Videos with non-square pixels are poorly supported; video playback is letterboxed; thumbnails get squashed (IT crowd)
 - Perhaps display multiple seasons in one menu? Separated by a text header?
 - Copy better thumbnail generation from mkv-gencover
