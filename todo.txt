 - Use upstream python-mpv (0.5.2 is broken for x11_display, see issue 169; 1.0.1 requires newer mpv)
 - Use upstream enzyme? (this version is patched for attachment support)
 - Fix sometimes-crash on seek (probably because MPV thread stuff)
 - Fix GLFW bugs
 - Split out file I/O etc to its own thread
 - Add better configuration file support
 - Add support for wallpaper
 - Maybe a living wallpaper?
 - Abstract out glfw key events
 - Videos with non-square pixels are poorly supported; video playback is letterboxed; thumbnails get squashed (IT crowd)
 - Perhaps display multiple seasons in one menu? Separated by a text header?
 - Copy better thumbnail generation from mkv-gencover
 - Text objects that are hidden shouldn't render when their text is updated
 - Dark mode should also postpone video position updates
 - Add menu sleep timer
 - Better subtitle UI
 - X11 support
 - See if EGL force in fabella.py is still needed
 - Add quick search
 - Improve logging; at least strip colors if stdout is not a tty
 - Load covers asynchronously
 - Offer better/simpler configuration of menu layout
 - Watch index/covers/state for changes on the fly
 - Add proper error checking on OpenGL calls
 - SuperTexture remove should join adjacent free spaces
 - Probably limit search text length
 - Reinstate Tile objects? Maybe light objects until they are rendered?
